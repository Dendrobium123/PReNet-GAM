## PReNet with GAM 

A deraining network based on the PReNet algorithm integrated with the GAM attention mechanism.

### Introduction
This thesis focuses on single-frame image de-raining research, utilizing deep learning methods and proposing a new method that enhances de-raining performance by integrating the Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) into the PReNet algorithm. PReNet is an efficient recursive network designed to remove raindrops from images, but it has some limitations in handling complex scenes. To address this issue, this paper introduces the GAM attention mechanism after each residual module, enhancing the networkâ€™s ability to perceive rainy areas and thereby more accurately removing rain streaks. Extensive experiments were con ducted on mainstream de-raining datasets such as Rain100L and Rain1400, and the results show that the new model integrated with the GAM attention mechanism significantly im proves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)comparedtotheoriginal PReNetmodel. Theseresults demonstrate the effectiveness and potential application value of the GAM attention mechanism in the task of de-raining.
